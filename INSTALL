This file describes how to compile the Brute-Force Game Engine.

Windows
=======

Download one of our dependency packages:

	https://forum.ultimatespaceproject.de/bundles

Then simply put everything from within the package into the engine root
directory.

If you can't find a package for your environment you'll have to bite the
bullet: All dependencies must be compiled manually and put into the thirdparty
directory.

Debian / Ubuntu and derivates
=============================

Download one of our dependency packages:

	https://forum.ultimatespaceproject.de/bundles

If you can't find a package for your architecture please use our make_deb.sh
script and try to build the package yourself. The $ARCH variable within the
script must be manually changed in order to do this. Please notice that this
script needs root privileges in order to install further dependencies.

How to install it:

	sudo dpkg -i package.deb

now install further dependencies:

	sudo apt-get install -f

At the time of this writing Boost 1.47.0 is quite new and I'm unable to find a
debian package for it. This is why I included Boost within our dependency
package which will conflict with older versions of Boost.  

Other Linux distributions
=========================

Take a look into our make_deb.sh script to see how we gathered all dependencies
together and do the same as for Ubuntu above.

Compiling
=========

Simply open up a shell, move to the root directory and create a new empty
directory for the build process.

At the first time you'll need to create some empty placeholders:

for Linux:
	
	./enuminit.sh

for Windows:

	enuminit.bat

This is necessary so that CMake can find some auto generated source files
(which haven't been generated at this point yet), if you don't do this you'll
get confusing linker errors.

Switch to the newly created folder and run cmake like this:

	cmake ..

This way you tell cmake to use the root directory for its run. After CMake has
completed successfully you can simply run:

	make

Have fun.
