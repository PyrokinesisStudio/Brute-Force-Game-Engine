About 
=====

The big strength of Brute-Force Game Engine lies in the combination of powerful open source
third party libraries. Our target is to connect this libs and build new higher-level 
functionality on top of them, but we don't want to hide or wrap them.

Out of this purpose, the engine allows direct control over several third party
resources like e.g. OGRE, so that the user gains a lot of control and may use
many cool features, but he also has to master the burden of many dependencies
which may soon become a maintainer's nightmare.

The more dependencies a project has, the higher is the likelihood that it could break.
It could constrain the future progress in features, could make interface changes or 
porting to other platforms difficult or even impossible. This is indeed one of the 
biggest problems we are dealing with. 

We have the highest ambitions to build stable interfaces and robust source code, but
if you want to use our engine, prepare yourself that your code will break from
time to time, because the engine is simply not done yet. We would never advice you to
wrap our engine though, as this is entirely pointless.

This engine was written with multi-platform support in mind, that is: Windows,
Linux and Mac. We try to keep the first two always running, but Mac support
has never been tested - We looking forward to find some motivated mac developer
who will start to support this.

Near in future there are two main goals:

- Implement network
- Stabilization of multi processor scalability

The current state of these features is highly experimental.

We invested a lot of time in this engine, so we hope you have fun using our
code and maybe somebody can learn something from it.
