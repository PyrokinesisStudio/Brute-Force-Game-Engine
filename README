About 
=====

The big strength of our engine lies in the combination of powerful open source
third party libraries. We want to connect them and build on top of them, but we
don't want to hide or wrap them. We want to develop new higher-level
functionality.

Out of this purpose, our engine allows direct control over several third party
resources like e.g. OGRE, so that the user gains a lot of control and may use
many cool features, but he also has to master the burden of many dependencies
which may soon become a maintainer's nightmare.

The more dependencies a project has, the more it is probable that it will break
in the future due to interface changes or that porting it to other platforms
may become difficult or even impossible. This is indeed one of the problems
we've ever been struggling with. Luckily, I am not aware of a problem that we
were not able to resolve.

We try to build stable interfaces and we try to write robust source code, but
if you want to use our engine, prepare yourself that your code will break from
time to time, since the engine is not simply done yet. I'd never advice you to
wrap our engine though, as this is entirely pointless.

This engine was written with multi-platform support in mind, that is: Windows,
Linux and Mac. We try to keep the first two always running, but Mac support
has had never been tested - I'm pretty sure in my assumption that it doesn't
work at all.

Also, we want network support and we want multi processor scalability.
The current state of these features is highly experimental.

We invested a lot of time in this engine, so we hope you have fun using our
code and maybe somebody can learn something from it.
